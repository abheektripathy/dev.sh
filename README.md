## Context:
[dev.sh](http://dev.sh/) is a comprehensive VS Code extension that provides a suite of developer tools to enhance coding efficiency and productivity. With three powerful features, [dev.sh]() aims to simplify common coding, Docker, and Git workflows.

The first feature is an intelligent code explainer powered by the GPT-3 model. With [dev.sh](), developers can select a block of code and request an explanation in plain English. The model generates a human-readable description of what the code does, its purpose, and its potential impact on the system. This feature reduces the need to manually interpret complex code snippets, especially in large codebases, saving developers time and effort.

The second feature is a search bar that converts user inputs in plain English to Git and docker commands. With [dev.sh](), developers can avoid the hassle of memorizing Git/docker commands and their parameters. Instead, they can simply type their desired action, such as "commit all changes," and the extension will generate the corresponding command.

In addition, [dev.sh]() provides GitHub Actions file templates that allow developers to automate their workflows. With these templates, developers can quickly set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines, reducing manual work and improving efficiency.

[dev.sh](http://dev.sh/) is designed to help developers streamline their coding, Docker, and Git workflows. It leverages natural language processing technologies to provide an intuitive and seamless experience. With [dev.sh](), developers can focus on writing great code and delivering value to their users.
